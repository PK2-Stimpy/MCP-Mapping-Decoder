# MCP-Mapping-Decoder
This is an mcp mapping decoder made for all versions.
You need a host server, the default is http://mcp.antecedentium.xyz/

# How to make a host server
You will need to have a website.
  1) Make a folder called 'mcpmappings'
  2) Add mcp folders with params.csv, methods.csv and fields.csv inside of it. *(Download: http://export.mcpbot.bspk.rs/stable/)*
  3) Add a file called 'mappings.info'
  4) Inside that file you will name all the mappings folders separated by a newline.
Now you will be able to connect thru this url: http://**HOST**/

# Todo
  1. Add multiple snapshots.
  2. Add folder support.
